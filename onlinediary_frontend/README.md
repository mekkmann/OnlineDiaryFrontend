Hello!

This is the frontend-part of the application, as I've continued to learn about how to use GitHub I now know that the backend and frontend could've been in the same repo. I haven't gotten to the clean-up part yet because this was a project for the SALT-bootcamp that had to be rushed.

This used to be a published app with full functionality, however, issues with Azure's Free Tier occurred and now it's a published app with almost no functionality. The authentication still works but that's about it.

As soon as I get the Azure ordeal under control I will re-launch all functionality.

I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

(All the frontend code is still in this repo, so feel free to check it out!)
